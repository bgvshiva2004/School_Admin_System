# School_Admin_System
A User friendly end to end Admin interface with login authentication to enroll,modify and view various data encountering in day to day work.

The prime intuition in developing the website is to provide an attractive and a quite handy interface for the school admin employees to work with the data which they deal with in their day to day operations.

## Usage and Web Workflow
* After giving a glance over the home page and other additional pages,the user navigates to the login page where the login box with the credentials of username and password are present besides an additional dropdown slot- role which has the values Admin, Employee, Student.
* Though the further interface and working operations are provided only for the person with admin role, the future development relies on developing an interface for the student and employee as well.
* Once the user's login credentials matches with the authenticated admin role based credentials, the page redirects to the main working interface

* Upon navigating into the enroll section, the user encounters four different diversities namely:

  - Student Management
  - Employee Management
  - Finance
  - Set Defaults

* Further, the sections aloow the admin to make different operations. For example, the operations that 'Set Defaults' avail are depicted as follows (in the white card region which appeared through flip on hover):

* Similarly, all the necessary operations and facilities are availed that are required for a school Admin officer, in a quite sorted and organised manner.
